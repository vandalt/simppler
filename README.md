# simppler: simpple Radial Velocities

`simppler` is a radial velocity fitting package built with [`simpple`](https://simpple.readthedocs.io).

My main goal writing this package was to test `simpple` on a problem I know well and for which I have a good benchmark code to follow, i.e. [RadVel](https://radvel.readthedocs.io/).

Take a look at the documentation for more information: <https://simppler.readthedocs.io>.
